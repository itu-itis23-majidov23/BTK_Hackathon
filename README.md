# Virtual Try-On

Virtual try-on application powered by [OOTDiffusion](https://github.com/levihsu/OOTDiffusion) that allows user to virtually try on user provided garment image or ai generated garment image. [FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) from [Nebius](https://nebius.com) AI Studio is used to generate the garment. The Gradio app connect to FastAPI backend server which is deployed on [Modal](https://modal.com) for running the inference pipeline on Nvidia A100 for faster inference. This application includes both a Gradio web interface and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server capabilities for seamless integration with AI assistants. Sample images for inference are obtained from [VITON-HD](https://github.com/shadow2496/VITON-HD)
